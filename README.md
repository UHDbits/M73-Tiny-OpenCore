  ## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
  
  **It is NOT recommended to use prebuilt OpenCore configurations. They might not work with the exact hardware of your computer, may have features enabled that you don't want, may be outdated, and are harder to diagnose. This configuration is meant to be used as a guide to help you create your own OpenCore configuration for this ThinkCentre, but it can be used as is, only at your own risk.**

  ## Updating OpenCore/macOS
  
  ### Updating OpenCore with a newer version of this configuration
  **If you want to update OpenCore with a newer version of this configuration, just download the new EFI folder, mount the EFI partition, and copy the folder to the partition. Note, if you've made any changes to the configuration, make sure to remember them or save them somewhere because any changes made will be overwritten.**

  ### Updating OpenCore/macOS manually
  **If you want to update OpenCore manually, you can follow [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/update.html#updating-opencore) (harder to follow, but recommended and tells you how to update macOS), or follow [this guide](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/347035-guide-updating-and-maintaining-opencore-new-method/) (easier to follow, but not recommended.) If you want to update macOS 13 Ventura or macOS 14 Sonoma, follow [this guide here.](/Resources/Documentation/OCLP.md#before-updating-macos)**

  ## Known Issues

  ### OpenCore Legacy Patcher Issues
  **Because macOS 13 Ventura and macOS 14 Sonoma do not officially support the hardware featured in this ThinkCentre, we have to use a tool called "OpenCore Legacy Patcher" to apply patches that allow us to use Ventura and Sonoma normally. Sadly, these patches do have some minor issues. To check the issues that affect this ThinkCentre, check [this link](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1008/) and look for "Haswell" in "Known Issues". As mentioned before, these bugs are quite minor and will not affect most people.**

  ### No VGA Output
  **Due to macOS not officially supporting VGA, you will not be able to output the macOS user interface via the VGA port featured on the ThinkCentre. At the moment, this is currently impossible to fix.**

  ### Monterey 12.3+ crashes during setup on the HD4400
  **With the HD4400, Monterey 12.3 or newer crashes during the "Migration Assistant" part of the setup. Sometimes, you can get past the screen, but it'll freeze later. This issue can only be fixed by upgrading your CPU to one with an HD4600 iGPU. It is unknown if this happens in Ventura or Sonoma.**

  ### HD4400 Glitching and Freezing
  **The HD4400 has many issues in macOS. For example, some icons may be missing (image below), some random freezes may happen, icons may get replaced, and possibly more. In newer versions of macOS, this can make the system almost unusable. This is impossible to fix at the moment, and the only thing you can do is upgrade your CPU to one with an HD4600 iGPU.**
